# RandomSpawn
This is the official github repository for RandomSpawn. This is a plugin originally created for BenProPlayz, owner of ProPlayz, but I decided to release it to the public due to how it may be useful for the public.

# Installing
Installing RandomSpawn is super simple, it has no dependencies so you can just put it in your plugins folder and it will work straight away.
